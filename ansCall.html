         <h1> PART 3: The Call </h1>
<div id='main'>
Just when he heard the call, he stopped his hand in the mid air and check who was calling.
He saw that it was a new number so he answered it. To his disappointment, it was the phone technician
calling him to check up on him. The old man told the technician he can't break the phone because
that was a gift from his dead wife. And so the old man lived a miserable life till he died.
